    In this study rats were trained to perform a task requiring context-dependent selection
    and accumulation of sensory evidence. The task was performed in a behavioural box consisting of three
    straight walls and one curved wall with three nose ports. Each nose port was equipped with an LED to
    deliver visual stimuli, and with an infrared beam to detect the rat's nose when entering the port.
    In addition, above the two side ports there were speakers to deliver sound stimuli, and water cannulas
    to deliver a water reward. At the beginning of each trial, rats were presented with an audiovisual cue
    indicating the context of the current trial. After the end of the context cue, the rats were required to
    place their nose into the centre port. While maintaining fixation in the centre port, rats were presented with a
    1.3-s-long train of randomly timed auditory pulses. Each pulse was played either from the speaker to the rat's left
    or from the speaker to their right, and each pulse a 5-ms pure tone with either low frequency (6.5 kHz)
    or high frequency (14 kHz). The pulse trains were generated by Poisson processes with different underlying
    rates. The strength of the location evidence was manipulated by varying the relative rate of right versus
    left pulses, and the strength of the frequency evidence was manipulated by varying the relative rate of
    high versus low pulses. The overall pulse rate was kept constant at 40 Hz.
  session_description: |
    This session contains behavioral data from a rat performing a context-dependent decision-making task.
    The task required the animal to accumulate sensory evidence over time and select an action based on the context
    cue for that trial. This dataset includes event timings, trial structure, stimulus parameters, and subject responses.
